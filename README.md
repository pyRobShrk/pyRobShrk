Hi, I'm Rob.

I'm not a real programmer.
I'm a civil engineer with a coding problem.
In 2015, while learning python, I did enough searching to participate in the [Google Foobar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) challenge.
I enjoyed the challenge, but it didn't result in an interview, despite being contacted by their recruiters.
In order to continue learning with coding challenges, I have participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Much of my AoC work was run in the browser with python through pyodide. I did all but 2019 in notebooks on [starboard.gg/robsh](https://starboard.gg/robsh).
2019 (IntCode) was my first attempt at AoC, and can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/pyRobShrk/aoc2019). I have a working IntCode VM in python, but I also have one in VBA/Excel so I could do maze problems using cells.

Most of my interesting code is at on my [Gist](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/).
A [simple USGS NationalMap 10m query](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/8df3a3c422fb1c88882a5e41b284349f) at least partially inspired the [code at pygeodesy](https://github.com/mrJean1/PyGeodesy/blob/master/pygeodesy/elevations.py).
At the time I created [geoid.py](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/98c43c25d4d3c5d105e90fa0b58cf823), there was no such functionality in pygeodesy.
It's possible, but not confirmed, that code inspired the implementation of Geoid 12B in [pygeodesy/geoids](https://github.com/mrJean1/PyGeodesy/blob/master/pygeodesy/geoids.py), as it functions similarly loading the binary file and interpolating with scipy.

Other notable code for Excel I've written:
* [An Array Formula for Muskingum Routing in Excel](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/1da91cace5026448c066dece0c1a516f)
* [Some LAMBDA functions in Excel, including linear interpolation by lookup, and Conway's Game of Life](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/d0fecbe74b1eab3d8477e5a1313fb87b)
* [Excel VBA Subs to calculate the area/length of polygons/lines drawn in Excel](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/17d85ce19b609725484da7085ab11503)
* [Excel VBA Sub to convert/extract a Chart Trendline, into a LINEST function with full precision](https://gist.github.com/pyRobShrk/4822939181aeab055ba1439ed14e911a)
